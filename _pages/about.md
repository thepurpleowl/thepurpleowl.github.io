I am currently wokring as a Project Associate at CTS, India. I am an undergraduate in CSE fromÂ [National Institute of Technology, Rourkela](https://http://nitrkl.ac.in/). My personal interest is in Machine Learning and NLP; apart from that I build Andriod Apps and take part in competitive coding in my free time. 

Besides my time in front of PC, I like to read biographies, blogs and sometimes watches different series. I love outdoor activities, i.e, sports\[TT, swimming], and often play chess online. 

I would love to be known by my handle "**thepurpleowl**"; someday :) !!

Here are some of the things I'm up to these days:
* Spending time on medium,
* Working on recommender systems,
* Personal research in Machine Learning on application of NLP.
