I am currently wokring as a Project Associate at CTS, India. I have a Undergraduate degree in CSE fromÂ [the National Institute of Rourkela](https://http://nitrkl.ac.in/). My personal interest is in the field of Machine Learning and NLP; apart from that I build Andriod Apps and take part in competitive coding in my free time. 

Besides my time in front of PC, I like to read biographies, psychology books and sometimes watches culinary shows. I am open to play chess and video games online.

Here are some of the things I'm up to these days:
* Spending time on medium,
* Working on recommender systems,
* Personal research in Machine Learning on application of NLP.
