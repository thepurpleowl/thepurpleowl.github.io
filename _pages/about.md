I am currently completing my masters from [IISc](https://iisc.ac.in/).  

Before that I was woking as a Project Associate at CTS, India after my undergraduate studies fromÂ [National Institute of Technology, Rourkela](http://nitrkl.ac.in/). 

My personal interest is in Machine Learning and NLP; apart from that I build Andriod Apps and take part in competitive coding in my spare time.  
Here are some of the things I'm up to these days:
* Spending time on medium
* Working on recommender systems
* Personal research in Machine Learning on application of NLP
