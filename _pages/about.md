I am currently wokring as a Project Associate at CTS, India. I am an undergraduate in CSE fromÂ [National Institute of Technology, Rourkela](https://http://nitrkl.ac.in/). My personal interest is in Machine Learning and NLP; apart from that I build Andriod Apps and take part in competitive coding in my spare time. 

Here are some of the things I'm up to these days:
* Spending time on medium,
* Working on recommender systems,
* Personal research in Machine Learning on application of NLP.
