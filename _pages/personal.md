Besides my time in front of PC, I like to read biographies, blogs and sometimes watch different series. I love outdoor activities, i.e, sports\[TT, swimming], and often play chess [online](https://www.chess.com/member/thepurpleowl). I enjoy gaming: both video games and individual games. 
I love to declare myself as a voracious movie watcher and gentle foodie and love to know people over food.

In addition, I enjoy occasional running, cycling sessions along with hiking and travelling. In fact I have a bucket list of places, would love to travel.

I would love to be known by my handle "**thepurpleowl**"; someday :) !!
