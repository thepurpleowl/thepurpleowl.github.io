When I'm not working, I have a number of hobbies. I enjoy gaming: both video games and individual games. 
I love to declare myself as a voracious movie watcher and gentle foodie and love to know people over food. In addition, I enjoy occasional running, cycling sessions
along with hiking and travelling. In fact I have a bucket list of places, would love to travel.


I am usually free on weekends and use the time to meet with people to talk on a diverse set of topics.
