Acceptance of Twitter as a reputed online media by masses on a large scale has resulted in twitter as a choice of playground for 
researchers in the field of computer science, psychologists and many others. Data from Twitter have been used to extract 
information and tailor information on various tasks such as sentiment analysis, sarcasm detection, event prediction, etc. As for 
how people perceive Twitter and how they construct their tweets in a complicated process, a similar one to writing, there are more 
than one factors affect how a tweet is being written. Many researchers have been done on the psycholinguistic perspective and 
statistic task(prediction, analysis) perspective individually. But as writing is a complex process even on a micro-blogging site, 
which needs synchronous thought process of choosing words and reaching target audience. Hence there is a need of combining 
psycholinguistic and statistical perspectives as one dimension to see the effect on the result. In this, we throw light on various 
psycholinguistic works and briefly discuss how they already have or how they can be extrapolated to statistic perspective. Along 
with that as original works we explored the effect of structure of tweet on existing  method-based and machine learning based 
sarcasm detection algorithms and interpretation of results.
